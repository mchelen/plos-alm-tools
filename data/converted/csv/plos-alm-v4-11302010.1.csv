"Information Relating to the Data Contained in this Spreadsheet",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This sheet contains a complete data set for all Article-Level Metrics at Public Library of Science (PLoS), and contains data which is correct as of Oct 31st 2010. This sheet is intended for large scale analysis and will be updated periodically. Detailed, 'live' information for each article can be found by visiting the article itself and exploring the ""Metrics"" tab (or by hitting the ""Download raw Metrics data as XML"" link at the bottom of each Metrics tab). More information about the PLoS Article-Level Metrics can be found in our FAQ at http://www.plos.org/about/faq.html#metrics; or at: http://www.plosone.org/static/almInfo.action; or at http://article-level-metrics.plos.org; or by emailing us at alm@plos.org.  We are aware of some people who have analysed our article-level metrics data and some of these are listed at: http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/#page-three ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This sheet contains several tabs - each is described below, along with a description of the fields in each one."
"""Summary ALM Data"" tab"
"This tab contains summary information for every Article-Level Metric that we track. More information can be found at: http://www.plosone.org/static/almInfo.action . The fields in this sheet are as follows: "
"DOI - The Digital Object Identifier (DOI) is a unique identifier for academic articles. It is possible to reconstruct a url for each article by pre-pending a string to the DOI. The pre-pend string for each journal is: http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/ (for PLoS ONE); http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/ (for PLoS Biology); http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi/  (for PLoS Medicine); http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info:doi/ (for PLoS Computational Biology); http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info:doi/ (for PLoS Genetics); http://www.plospathogens.org/article/info:doi/ (for PLoS Pathogens);  http://www.plosntds.org/article/info:doi/ (for PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases); and http://clinicaltrials.ploshubs.org/article/info:doi/ (for PLoS Clinical Trials - a journal which is no longer published). For example, an acceptable url for DOI = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0000001 would be: http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.0000001 "
"URL - the internet URL of the article."
"Publication Date - the official publication date of the article. Note: A small number of articles were made available in advance of their official publication date. The complete usage data are noted in these sheets, but the graphs for each article are only drawn from the publication date forwards."
"Publication Year - the official year of publication of the article."
"Journal - the name of the PLoS Journal,."
"Research Article' or 'non-Research Article'? - PLoS publishes several different types of articles, but broadly they can be classified into Research Articles and non-Research Articles (reviews, for example, or articles which are typically more journalistic in content and which are often found at the front of a journal). We have provided an indication of which article type each article is, as there are differences in the behaviour between the types. Note: PLoS ONE only contains Research Articles."
"Article Title - this is an indication of the title of each article. Because of the conversion to ASCII for import into this spreadsheet the text will not be an exact match with the real title, and may contain unsual characters. Therefore this column is provided only as an indication."
"Citations - CrossRef - this is a count of how many citations are recorded to this article by CrossRef."
"Citations - PubMed Central - this is a count of how many citations are recorded to this article by PubMed Central."
"Citations - Scopus - this is a count of how many citations are recorded to this article by Scopus. There is a known issue with this count such that Scopus sometimes undercounts citations to PLoS articles. We are working with Scopus to fix this error."
"Note: As a general rule, all three citation services will record different sets of citation data, therefore the three data sets would need to be compared and 'de duplicated' to get a complete picture of citation activity."
"Total HTML Page Views - this is a total number for the HTML page views to each article, correct from Publication Date through January 31st 2010. Monthly data are broken out in tab 4."
"Total PDF Downloads -  this is a total number for the PDF downloads for each article, correct from Publication Date through January 31st 2010. Monthly data are broken out in tab 5."
"Total XML Downloads -  this is a total number for the XML downloads for each article, correct from Publication Date through January 31st 2010. Monthly data are broken out in tab 6."
"Combined Usage (HTML + PDF + XML) - this is the sum of the previous three numbers."
"Note: Detailed information on usage data can be found at http://www.plosone.org/static/usageData.action"
"Blog Coverage - Postgenomic -  this is a count of how many blog postings refer to this article, as indexed by the Postgenomic service."
"Blog Coverage - Nature Blogs -  this is a count of how many blog postings refer to this article, as indexed by the Nature Blogs service."
"Blog Coverage - Bloglines -  this is a count of how many blog postings refer to this article, as indexed by the Bloglines service."
"Blog Coverage - ResearchBlogging.org -  this is a count of how many blog postings refer to this article, as indexed by the ResearchBlogging.org service."
"Note: As a general rule, all four blog aggregating services will record different sets of data, therefore the four data sets would need to be compared and 'de-duplicated' to get a complete picture of blog activity (as recorded by these services)."
"Number of Trackbacks - this is an indication of the number of trackbacks that have been made to this article by external sites."
"Social Bookmarking - CiteULike - this is a count of how many bookmarks have been made to this article by users of the CiteULike social bookmarking service.",,,,
"Social Bookmarking - Connotea - this is a count of how many bookmarks have been made to this article by users of the Connotea social bookmarking service.",,,,
,,,,
"Number of Ratings - this is a count of how many times an article has been 'rated' on our site ."
"Average Rating - ratings can be made in several categories (and in addition, older rating functionality on some titles only allowed a single rating to be made). This therefore indicates the average rating that the article has received."
"Number of Note threads - users can leave a 'Note' on a specific piece of text in any article. Once a Note has been left, it forms a discussion thread to which other users can reply. This field provides a count of how many Note threads have been started on the article."
"Number of replies to Notes - once a Note thread has been started, users can reply in that thread. This field provides a count of how many replies to Note threads have been made, in total."
"Number of Comment threads - users can leave a 'Comment' on the entire article. Once a Comment has been left, it forms a discussion thread to which other users can reply. This field provides a count of how many Comment threads have been started on the article."
"Number of replies to Comments - once a Comment thread has been started, users can reply in that thread. This field provides a count of how many replies to Comment threads have been made, in total."
"Number of 'Star Ratings' that also include a text comment - when users leave a Rating on an article they also have the opportunity to leave a text comment. This text comment is not noted in the 'Comments' or 'Notes' functionality on our site. Therefore to get a complete picture of all comment activity you should include the comments that are left as part of a Rating. This field indicates how many comments have been left in this way."
"""Topic Areas per Article"" tab"
"Upon submission, each article is tagged (by the authors) as being in one or more specific topic areas. This tab therefore indicates the topics which have been assigned to each article. If you wanted to do an analysis of usage per topic area then you would need to use this tab to filter out all the articles assigned to a specific topic. Any given article will appear in more than one row, depending on how many topic areas it is assigned to. We have provided some basic summary data, aggregated by topic, at: http://www.plos.org/static/journalStatistics.action"
"Combined Downloads; HTML Views Usage; PDF Downloads; XML Downloads tabs"
"These four tabs provide month by month data for each usage type. Detailed information on usage data can be found at http://www.plosone.org/static/usageData.action ."
"Known Issues"
"Some known issues are listed at: http://www.plosone.org/static/almInfo.action#knownIssues . In addition to these issues, we are aware that a small number of articles exhibit unusual usage patterns (e.g. extremely high usage). Without a detailed investigation it is impossible to tell whether this usage is intentional (e.g. media coverage, educational use) or unintentional (e.g., ”robots” trying to leave advertising messages on our articles). In the name of transparency, unless we are sure the usage was invalid, we continue to report it on the article pages themselves, but when presenting our “average usage” summary tables (as posted at http://www.plosone.org/static/journalStatistics.action) we err on the safe side and exclude those articles that may have experienced invalid usage. Specifically, for the summary tables that PLoS updated in May 2010, we excluded data from four articles (10.1371/journal.pmed.0040161; 10.1371/journal.pone.0000506; 10.1371/journal.pgen.0020143; 10.1371/journal.ppat.0030167)."
"Change History"
"Article-Level Metrics at PLoS are an evolving project; as a result, the way we collect and report these data may change over time. The text below details some recent changes (in reverse chronological order):"
"Some third party Article-Level Metrics data sources became inoperable during 2010 causing us to temporarily stop collecting data from them. We hope this situation will be reversed in the near future, however users should be aware of the following issues: We stopped compiling new data from ResearchBlogging in April 2010 due to an unresponsive API. We stopped compiling new data from Connotea in Sept 2010, again due to an unresponsive API. Finally, Postgenomic was closed down in October 2010 and so data from that source stopped at that time. We hope to re-activate data collation from ResearchBlogging and Connotea in December 2010, and we will be removing Postgenomic data from our display also in December 2010."
"In early April 2010 we discovered that, due to problems with one of our two servers, since 26 November 2009 about half of our usage had not been reported. Therefore, in mid-April 2010 we added these missing data to each article in our corpus. We also used this opportunity to apply our enhanced algorithms (noted below) for usage in the period June 2009 through April 2010. As a result of adding the missing log files, the reported usage data for most articles increased for the period November 2009 through April 2010; however, because most of the anomalous usage data (noted below) had also been removed, the reported usage data of some articles decreased. Despite these improvements, a small number of articles still exhibit some unusual usage behaviors as noted above. "
"In early 2010 we became aware of some unintentional usage on a small number our articles for the period roughly August 2009 through January 2010. This usage appeared to be the action of automated processes on the internet (for example, ""robots"" trying to leave advertising messages on our articles). In January 2010, our algorithm was enhanced to reduce the impact of this anomalous activity, but as the historical data remained we were careful to remove the data for some articles, so as that we did not unnaturally 'skew' the averages data. Specifically, we excluded data for 16 articles from the summary usage tables of March 2010 (as posted at: http://www.plosone.org/static/journalStatistics.action) (10.1371/journal.pmed.0040161; 10.1371/journal.pone.0000506; 10.1371/journal.pgen.0020143; 10.1371/journal.pbio.0020247; 10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020063; 10.1371/journal.pbio.0040447; 10.1371/journal.pone.0000959; 10.1371/journal.pone.0003574; 10.1371/journal.pone.0003762; 10.1371/journal.pone.0002171; 10.1371/journal.pone.0005420; 10.1371/journal.pone.0003390; 10.1371/journal.pone.0001270;10.1371/journal.pone.0001462; 10.1371/journal.pone.0002239; 10.1371/journal.pctr.0010026). For the tables presented in May 2010, this list was reduced to four articles, as noted above."
